# Development-X-Text2ALM

Text2ALM is a separate repo found [here](https://github.com/cdolson19/Text2ALM).

The experimental directory contains experimental clingo programs and xclingo trace rule files along with xlcingo output files. 

The goal of this repository is to track development towards a new system that synthesizes Text2ALM with [Xclingo](https://github.com/bramucas/xclingo) to provide rich explanations on answer sets derived from plain text input.

In addition, we will want to be able to input questions as input and obtain answers in plain language.
